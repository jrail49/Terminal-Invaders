# Extra Credit
### About
I will be making a game for extra credit.
I plan on making a space invaders game, 
but i will be following a tutorial on how 
to create a snake game first. The completed
snake game will remain in this repo for referece.

### Controls 
Use the left and right arrow keys to make, space and up arrow key to fire, 'r' to reset and 'q' to quit. 

### Gameplay
The space invaders will kill you in one hit (in you have 1 hp (health point)). However, the space invaders have 2hp and will take 2 hits to kill. 
When an invader is hit it will become smaller and when it dies there is a short death animation. 
You must destroy all of the space invaders to win. If a space invader kills you you lose. You will also lose if a space invader manages to get past you.
